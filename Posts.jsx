Either way, they all add flavor to your life, whether it's savory, bitter, or sweet #therapy",

      desc: "After my husband of 12 years walked away, leaving me with just $24 to my name, I felt as if my heart was ripped open and anxiety took root in my soul. Through therapy, I discovered a profound truth: we don’t need to shout “fire” at every shadow of fear. God has shown me that the flames of anxiety are often just the enemy’s smoke screen. I’ve learned not to let rejection define me, for my identity is firmly set by Christ ✝️ In Him, I find my worth and purpose, and with His strength, I rise above the storms within",

I spent my youth as a rebellious and angry kid, struggling with a torrent of emotions. But through therapy, I discovered that my past does not dictate my future. I found solace and transformation in ballet, a discipline that has helped me heal and rediscover myself. Now, every time I dance, I’m not just performing steps—I’m reclaiming my strength and grace, proving to myself that my past does not define my worth",

You can bend over backward, do everything they ask, and yet somehow, it never feels like it’s enough. Despite your best efforts, you may still find that they walk away, leaving you feeling unappreciated and hollow. It's a harsh lesson that no amount of self-sacrifice can guarantee acceptance or love. I've learned that true fulfillment comes from within, and it's essential to prioritize my own well-being and self-worth over trying to please others who may never truly value me",
